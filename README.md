HTMLAPI
=======

Using the AppBrain API to pull in and display App Info from App Brain. Currently in the process of upgrading to the 
unofficial Play Store API and creating a wordpress plugin.

Needed examples:

Example of Package Name, com.android.chrome used to display Chrome App. <br>
Example of Verbage, Download Chrome from the Play Store.

The HTML section can be copied and pasted where you are wanting it.
Paste the CSS inside you style.css. I have only tested this with Wordpress. If you have issues please let me know.
